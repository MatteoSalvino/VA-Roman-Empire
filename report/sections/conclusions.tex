\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
We believe that this work already represents a good and innovative tool for an interactive analysis of the Roman military: it comes in handy because it offers
\begin{itemize}
    \item the possibility to select and filter data
    \item an instant visual information of the selected events
    \item some basic analytics
    \item hyperlinks for further details
\end{itemize}

Several directions can be investigated in the future and many extensions may be taken into account. Among them we remark:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dataset extension: improve the dataset quality, adding more fields, e.g. external sources or bibliography for each battle or war
    \item Predefined filters: provide to the user a list of historical relevant filters, such as "Pax Romana"
    \item Dynamic boundaries visualization: dynamically change the borders, depending on the period
\end{itemize}
