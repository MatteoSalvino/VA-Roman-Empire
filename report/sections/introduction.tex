\section{Introduction}
To start our project we needed a dataset about the Roman empire battles, but unfortunately there wasn't available on the web. Thus, we started with building our own dataset from a Wikipedia page that contains useful information about the Roman empire history. In particular, our dataset starts from 6th century BC to 6th century AC. In this way, we were able to build a set of views, which provides a set of interactions. We focused on the type of features to provide to the users : in fact is possible to filters the data based on the given time period such as analyze how many battles the Roman empire won and lost, which types of battles has occurred, read further information on a battle thanks to the link provided in the geographic map's legend when that battle is selected. The primary goal of our project is to be intended as a support tool that helps users to learn the detailed Roman empire history through a multi coordinate visualization built with D3.js framework.
