\section{Introduction}
\begin{displayquote}
    "If any people ought to be allowed to consecrate their origins and refer them to a divine source, so great is the military glory of the Roman People that when they profess that their Father and the Father of their Founder was none other than Mars, the nations of the earth may well submit to this also with as good a grace as they submit to Rome's dominion." \textasciitilde T. Livius

The military of ancient Rome is unanimously considered a key element in the rise of Rome over above seven hundred years, from a small settlement in Latium to the capital of a wide empire around the shores of the Mediterranean sea.
The role and structure of the military were modified many times during this long period: we decided to develop a tool to analyze the main battles and wars involving the Roman army.

We started with building our own dataset (see \ref{sec:dataset}) from a Wikipedia page which contains useful information about the ancient Roman history.
In particular, our dataset collects most of the Roman battles, from 6th century BC to 6th century AD. We later built a set of views (see \ref{sec:visualization}): each of them provides a set of interactions.
We focused on the type of features to provide to the users: in fact is possible to filter the data based on the given time period, analyze how many battles (and their type) the Romans won and lost, read further information on a battle thanks to the info-box popup that is shown when a battle is selected on the map.
The primary goal of our project is to provide an educational tool, helping users to interactively learn the very detailed ancient Roman history through a multi coordinate visualization built with D3.js framework.
