  abstract  = {R. A. Fisher's canonical analysis of contingency tables is shown to be applicable to incidence data as well as to contingency tables, and is accordingly designated by another author's name "correspondence analysis". In a theoretical section, the method is shown to be equivalent to a special case of Hotelling's canonical correlation analysis and also to a scale-free variant of principal components analysis. A practical example is examined, and a number of practical considerations discussed.},
